Module 3 - LMS 
Description:
The purpose of this project is to develop, design, and build a Library Management System (LMS) that runs in a console-based environment. 
The goal of this system is to allow librarians to add, remove patrons, and display a list of all current patrons using their unique IDs. 
The system will store each patronâ€™s data in a text file, ensuring that information is secured for each session. 
The design of the system is focused on a simple, reliable, and user-friendly system that provides librarians 
with an efficient way to manage patron records without needing a database.
